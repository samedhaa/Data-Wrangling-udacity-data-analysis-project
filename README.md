# Data Wrangling
##### This project is about data wrangling were i had to use the three stages of data wrangling (gather, asses, clean).
##### with gathering i had to gather one dataset from udacity(udacity provided to download manually) and the other using Request library in python because the data were in a url also provided by UDACITY and then i had to use Twitter API to gather the last dataset.

##### in the assesing i defined tidy and quality data issues that are in those three datasets i gathered by visualizing by viewing the data on excel sheet and then programmatically by using different python pandas tools

##### the cleaning proccess i fixed the tidy and quality issues using coding , and then i tested if what i did fixed the problem, i used to define the isuue before start coding , there were many issues to fix so the data can be ready to be visualized properly.
##### i made 3 insights and a visulization about the dataset after storing the datasets in just one dataset (the analysis and visualization isn't advanced just basic analysis).
#### â€¢ [you can navigate the data with IPython Notebook (Jupyter) using mybinder in the link below by clicking here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/samedhaa/Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data-Udacity-Data-Analysis-Project04/master)
